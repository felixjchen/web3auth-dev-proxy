# Normal Domain

www.abc.com

# Subdomain Domain

www.felix.abc.com

# Problem statements

- I want to reverse proxy from the first element in the path, use that first element as the subdomain

e.g. www.abc.com/felix/shane -> www.felix.abc.com/shane

# Why ?

- related to a whitelisting problem
- dev
